Vite/React Template used to build a simple project from Frotn End Mentor to display some level of competence using React.
This project was styled mobile first and modified for desktop afterwards through te use of a screen-size media query.
Spent some time creating the containers for the different data values and mapping the responses in order to correctly style them based on the category of information, but well worth the experience.
